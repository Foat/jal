1. *Which platforms/operation systems are supported by JAL*?  
JAL was created as a cross-platform appication based on *python* and GUI library *[Qt](https://www.qt.io/)*.
Thus, theoretically, it should work on any platform that supports python and Qt installation.  
Installation and usage were tested on Linux, Windows and MacOS systems.
